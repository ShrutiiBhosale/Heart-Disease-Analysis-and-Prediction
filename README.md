# Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting heart disease using a dataset of patient information. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify patients based on the likelihood of having heart disease.




## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains several features related to patient health, including : 
 * Age
 * sex
 * cholestoral
 * blood pressure
 * maximum heart rate
 * Wave abnormality
 * diabetes
 * stress level
 * fasting blood sugar



## Modelling and Prediction
* Logistic Regression
* K-nearest Neighbors
* Random Forest
The final model will be selected based on its performance on the validation set and other evaluation metrics.
